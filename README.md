# PSOMI.v2 (ZRpB)

An open-source Proxy bot designed for Role-Playing.


## Why PSOMI.v2?

Discord has plenty of Role-Playing focused proxy bots, but PSOMI.v2 aims to be more than just another. Here's what it has to offer!

### Stronger, Smarter, Better!

PSOMI is being rewritten from the ground up, making v2 better in every way! PSOMI.v2 can parse, respond, and edit faster than ever before, all powered by wonderful SQL!

### Open-Source

PSOMI.v2 will always keep its code open, making it easier to find and squash bugs, add features, and host your own instance!

Not only that, but PSOMI.v2's code has been designed with **simplicity** and **expandability** in mind. If you don't like something, change it! With a class-based approach, and plenty of documentation built into the codebase, PSOMI.v2 will do its best to help!

### Preferences Galore!

_(coming soon!)_

PSOMI.v2 is being re-designed around _you_ (or your users!), allowing almost every aspect of your Proxy experience to be changed and modified to your liking!

### And So Much More!

PSOMI.v2 isn't done yet, and will continue to grow when it is! View the Roadmap (coming soon) to see what's done, what's being done, and what's planned for the future!


## Why (not) PSOMI.v2?

PSOMI.v2 is currently in a _very_ early state, meaning things may be broken, non-functional, or buggy! While bug-reports are absolutely appreciated, it isn't recommended you use PSOMI.v2 for anything big, lest it gets confused and you lose your hard work.

However, we're almost there! Commands are being worked on, and the rewrite is about 40% complete, with progress being made every week! Stay tuned, because PSOMI.v2 has so much to show!
